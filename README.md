# WalletShare
## Android project by [Sachin](https://github.com/MrSachin7) and [Himal](https://github.com/himal28924)

The Android software WalletShare allows for excellent money management. The application keeps track of your spending throughout the month and provides you with a thorough breakdown of how you spend your hard-earned cash. Another important aspect of the app is the option to divide the cost with your friends or roommates without worrying about the trouble.

We chose to create this app because of our extremely personal experiences, . Being students, we must be frugal with our expenses. Sometimes we spend a lot of money that is not essential on various things. We think that a detailed breakdown of our spending will help us manage it more effectively.

We frequently go out to dine, and some people pay the bill that must be split between everyone. As the population grows, complexity also grows exponentially. As a result, the app will have a function that enables users to simply share expenses and deftly determine how much money needs to be divided among the group.
